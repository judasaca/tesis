\noindent{\Huge\textit{Acknowledgments}}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\textit{I would like to thank my advisor, Andrés Flórez, for all his support and dedication during this last year of hard work, and all his accurate recommendations. I would also like to thank my family, and in particular my mom for all her sacrifices and undivided attention to give me the best possible life, I owe this all to her. I am also deeply grateful with my friends and comrades, specially Liliana Quintero and Santiago Beltrán for their tireless friendship and company throughout this last four years, I would have not made it this far without them. Last but not least, I would also like to thank Phenomenology students Gustavo Ardila and Manuel Sánchez, for their invaluable help and guidance without which this thesis would have been an impossible feat. }
